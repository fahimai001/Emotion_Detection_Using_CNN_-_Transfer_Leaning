# Emotion_Detection_Using_CNN_-_Transfer_Leaning

This project focuses on detecting emotions from facial expressions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By leveraging pre-trained models such as VGG-16 and ResNet through Transfer Learning, we were able to build an efficient emotion recognition system with an accuracy of 80%. The model classifies facial images into distinct emotion categories such as happy, sad, angry, and surprised.

Key Features:
Pre-trained Models: VGG-16, ResNet
Transfer Learning: Enhances performance on a smaller dataset
High Accuracy: Achieved 80% accuracy on the test set
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
